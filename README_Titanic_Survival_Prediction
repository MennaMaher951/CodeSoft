Titanic Survival Prediction with Machine Learning
Description:

This repository contains the Python code used to build a machine learning model for predicting passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The model is based on the Logistic Regression algorithm and trained using historical data from the Titanic dataset.

Key Elements:

Data preprocessing:

Import essential libraries (pandas, numpy, etc.).
Load the Titanic dataset.
Handle missing values (e.g., filling with mean/median).
Encode categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
Exploratory data analysis (EDA):
Analyze characteristics of the data (e.g., passenger class, sex, age).
Visualize relationships between features and survival (e.g., count plots).
Model training:
Separate features (X) and target variable (y).
Split data into training and testing sets (80%/20%).
Create a Logistic Regression model with regularization (e.g., L2 penalty).
Train the model on the training set.
Model evaluation:
Calculate accuracy on the training and testing sets.
Perform cross-validation to estimate generalization ability.
Print evaluation scores in a clear and well-formatted manner.
Code Structure:
Data loading and preprocessing: Load and clean the Titanic dataset.
Exploratory data analysis: Analyze and visualize the data.
Feature engineering: Encode categorical features.
Model training and evaluation: Train and evaluate the Logistic Regression model.
